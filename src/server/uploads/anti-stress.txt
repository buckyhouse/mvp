- small hits all over the body like a massage to activate it
- close your eyes and identify where the feeling is coming from
- deep intense breathing for a while to lower stress and tension

to increase your performance

- increase your necessity, change your frame from "I should do it", "this is necessary because that's who I am, someone needs me to do this well I'm obsessed to make this excellent". You gotta be obsessed
- It's not the same as passion. Obession vs passion is where people think you are crazy where in passion people think you're doing great. It's really important to be very obsessive.
- A real obsession like making a difference in someones life creates feedback which is rejection, people don't like rejection because you'll be jugded and will focus on you.
- Change your frame, repeat it.
